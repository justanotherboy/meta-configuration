I. WARNING
==========

This layer is intended for developers that heavily make configuration
changes for testing purposes. DO NOT use for stable projects.


II. Motivation
==============

Open Embedded is a very big project, and remembering all configuration changes
it is difficult to achive. If you keep a single build directory all
configuration changes goes to a single local.conf that gets unmaintainable; if
you use a separate build directory you would need to modify local.conf with
every new directory.

If you are heavily involved in generic layer development you'll need to test
your changes with a wide range of configurations, and this layer could help
to make your life easier.


III. How is structured
======================

conf/site.conf:
  Main configuration file. This is where you can easily enable or disable
  configuration. By default includes some files in the local directory that
  mostly are for system specific options, such as cache directories and
  mirrors. It also contains all the available configuration changes that can be
  enable just uncommenting the line, by default these changes are disabled.

conf/local:
  This directory is used for local configuration files that differ from host to
  host; perhaps they might be merged in a single file, but is separated for easy
  sharing. This directory have some example files, you just need to copy
  (without .example) and modify them to suite your needs.

conf/core:
  This directory is used for configuration changes used in openembbedded-core
  layer. Changes are generice so, everyone can use them. This directory include
  subdirectories to improve maintainability.

conf/<layer>:
  Additional configuration for other layers. It is not implemented yet, but if
  you do, please keep the same structure as conf/core.


IV. How to use it
=================

1. Clone this layer.
2. Copy example configuration files as .conf files:

  for i in local/*.example; do
    cp -a $i ${i%%.example}
  done

3. Customize .conf files in local directory to suite your needs.
4. Add meta-configuration to your BBLAYERS.
5. Enable/disable configuration using conf/site.conf file.
